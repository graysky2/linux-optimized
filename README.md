# linux-optimized
More or less the old linux-ck but without ck patches since they are no longer maintained

This is the PKGBUILD and files I use for hosting optimized package in [repo-ck].  You may download them on my unofficial repo, see [this](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Unofficial_user_repositories/Repo-ck) wiki page.
